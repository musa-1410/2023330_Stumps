Project Title: Stumps - Cricket scoring simulation
Project By: Mohammad Musa Ali, Muhammad Umer, Sarosh Ishaq

Our project is a Cricket Scoring System designed to simulate and manage the scoring of cricket matches efficiently using advanced data structures such as queues, stacks, and linked lists. It provides an interactive platform for scoring, tracking player statistics, and determining match outcomes (win probability), making it a valuable tool for cricket scorers to organize matches and get detailed statistics for the game.
